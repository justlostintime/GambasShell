# GambasShell
Gambas shell gsh for linux required Gambas3 3.14.90 or higher.
This can be used as a complete bash shell replacement. Very useful for education and general scripting of tasks in your system. GSH integrates many of the features of posix shells with the more regular language structure provided by 'GAMBAS almost means BASIC.'

```
As an example:
    
   for i as integer 0 to 100
      echo count {i}  interates $"This{1..100}"
      next
or

  for each i as integer in $"0..100"
     echo {i}
     next
or 

  for each s as string in $"*/*.h"
    print "File name";; s;; "found"
    next
```
Only the Ubuntu and Mint Versions of linux have been well tested so far.
So be careful with the other. Please report any issues thanks.

With update 1.2.65 the structure of the shell commands has changed.
So if you are updating from a revision before 1.2.65 then please run clearsubs on the
first start, exit gsh and restart it.
Remeber to save all your personal subs/functions/procedures before clearing the in memory subs.
This ensures the use of the new structure.

Clearing the subs is a good idea after each release if you can.

Clear subs using : clearsubs ' Subroutines are loaded into the gsh.image on first use 

Save your personal subs using : savesubs "sub1" "sub2" ....

If you want to use gsh as your login script then you must add an entry to the 
    /etc/shells
add this line at the end:
    /usr/bin/gsh

Change the defult shell in your user account. Or the /etc/passwd file
depending on your linux release. 

Better still use 'chsh -e /usr/bin/gsh' command to change your shell. 
Be sure to log out and back in for it to take effect.
