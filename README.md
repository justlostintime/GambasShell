# GambasShell
Gambas shell gsh for linux required Gambas3 3.14.90 or higher

Only the Ubuntu version/linux mint have been well tested so far.
So be careful with the other. Please report any issues thanks.

With update 1.2.65 the structure of the shell commands has changed.
So if you are updating from a revision before 1.2.65 then please run clearsubs on the
first start, exit gsh and restart it. This ensures the use of the new structure.

If you want to use gsh as your login script then you must add an entry to the 
    /etc/shells
add this line at the end:
    /usr/bin/gsh

Change the defult shell in your user account. Or the /etc/passwd file
depending on your linux release. 

Better still use 'chsh -e /usr/bin/gsh' command to change your shell. 
Be sure to log out and back in for it to take effect.
